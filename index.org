* Github
I am learning how to use github, it pretty handy, just needs some time and repetitive practice.  The basic steps are below:

** Git locally


#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
git init # initialize a folder .git/
# create a file
touch newfile # Ctrl+D to save and exit
git status # now newfile is untracked
git add newfile # to bring file in the staged level
git commit -m 'Initial commit' # to make file ready for push
#+END_SRC

** Git publicly
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
git remote # this should return 'origin'
git push origin master # git asks for credentials
#+END_SRC


** Using Magit
Magit is an emacs package with which you can handle git more interactively.  With following steps you can push your code on github. With =M-x magit-status= magit opens a buffer which tracks your activity.  In this buffer you can your local path to the working directory, your remotes, and the last commit online (=Head=).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x magit-status
s => to stage
c c => to commit
P P => to push
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Orgmode
* Emacs
