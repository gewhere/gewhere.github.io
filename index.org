* About
These are personal notes, if anyone finds this documentation helpful I will be glad too.  I adopt this template from [[http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][Sacha Chua]], and it is written in [[http://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]].  You can find the orgmode and html files [[https://github.com/gewhere/gewhere.github.io][here]].

* Github
I am learning how to use github, it's pretty handy, just needs some time and repetitive practice.  The basic steps are below:

** Git locally
You can use git only locally, though one of the main concept behind git and version control systems is that of collaborative coding.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
git init 			# initialize a folder .git/
# create a file
touch newfile 			# Ctrl+D to save and exit
git status 			# now newfile is untracked
git add newfile 		# to bring file in the staged level
git commit -m 'Initial commit' 	# to make file ready for push
#+END_SRC

Branching is a core concept for handling big programming projects.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
git brach NewBranch    	# creates a new branch
git branch             	# returns the working branch
git checkout NewBranch 	# you are now in the NewBranch
touch newfile          	# create a newfile in the NewBranch
                       	# this file does not exists in the working directory
                       	# unless you 'git merge'
git checkout master    	# the master branch is by default the branch that git initialise
git merge NewBranch    	# at this point the newfile appears
#+END_SRC

** Git publicly
When you =git clone= a repository to your hard disc, you clone this from a /remote/.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
git remote 		# this should return 'origin'
git remote -v 		# returns the online repository
git push origin master 	# git asks for credentials
#+END_SRC


** Using Magit
Magit is an emacs package with which you can handle git more interactively.  With following steps you can push your code on github. With =M-x magit-status= magit opens a buffer which tracks your activity.  In this buffer you can see your local path to the working directory, your remotes, and the last commit online (=Head=).

At the top of your files in the magit's buffer there is a button like text region which says either =Unstaged changes= for files that are untracked, either =Staged Changes= for files that are in the staged level, or =Unpushed commits=.
- =M-x magit-status= OR =C-x g=
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
s => to stage
c c => to commit
P P => to push
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Using branches
- By default git uses a =master= branch.  To switch to a different branch (let the name of the branch  *source*) =M-x magit-status= and =b=, and =b= for /checkout/.
- To apply the changes of =source= branch to =master=, *checkout* to master branch and merge.  Be sure that you don't have any unstaged changes.
- After this step your changes have been applied to =master= branch and you are ready to =stage= and =commit= them.

* Orgmode
I am using GNUPLOT to plot orgmode's tables.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(local-set-key "\M-\C-g" 'org-plot/gnuplot)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: org-plot/gnuplot

** Org-tables
